1. len() function was good to count number of items in the list. but what if
 not every item in list had "price" and you wanted to know the number of items 
 in your list with a price

2. when we did print(p["name"]) what was the p for?

3. Please explain what is going on here "${0:.2f}".format(p["price"])
